# GitHub Pages Project - Fresh Start

## Project Overview
This repository contains a GitHub Pages project that has gone through several iterations since 2019. The project is currently in a transitional state, and we're starting fresh while preserving the original code for reference.

## Repository Structure
- `.github/`: GitHub-specific configuration files, including workflows for deployment
- `legacy/`: Original code (preserved, read-only)

## Project History
The original website was a traditional HTML site (preserved in the `legacy` folder). There was an attempt to modernize it using React and Vite, but that implementation was incomplete and has been cleaned up.

## Development Plan
dunno

## Legacy Code
The `legacy` folder contains the original website code and should be treated as read-only. It's preserved for reference purposes only.
