# GitHub Pages Project - Fresh Start

## Project Overview
This repository contains a GitHub Pages project that has gone through several iterations since 2019. The project is currently in a transitional state, and we're starting fresh while preserving the original code for reference.

## Repository Structure
- `.github/`: GitHub-specific configuration files, including workflows for deployment
- `.junie/`: Project tracking and documentation
- `legacy/`: Original code (preserved, read-only)

## Project History
The original website was a traditional HTML site (preserved in the `legacy` folder). There was an attempt to modernize it using React and Vite, but that implementation was incomplete and has been cleaned up.

## Development Plan
We're starting fresh with a clean slate. The `.junie/` directory contains our project tracking files:

- `guidelines.md`: Overall project guidelines and approach
- `tasks.md`: Specific tasks and cleanup instructions

## Getting Started
To contribute to this project:

1. Review the files in the `.junie/` directory to understand the project plan
2. Follow the cleanup instructions in `.junie/tasks.md` if they haven't been completed yet
3. Implement the new website according to the technology decision documented in `.junie/tasks.md`

## Legacy Code
The `legacy` folder contains the original website code and should be treated as read-only. It's preserved for reference purposes only.

## Deployment
This site is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/learn-gh-action.yml`.
