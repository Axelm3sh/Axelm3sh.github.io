    <h2>Course Expectations</h2>
    <main>
        <p>There are several reasons to why I took this course.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Portfolio Work</h3></li>
            <p>Handing in a resume in one thing, but having a website that acts as a portfolio piece to display other portfolio pieces? Genius.</p>
            
            <li><h3>Polish and Broaden Skills</h3></li>
            <p>I like to code, HTML with CSS and Javascript mixed in is another way I can express myself, if people need a designer to help visualize their content to the world, web building is a gate way to one of those paths.</p>
            <li><h3>Have fun</h3></li>
            <p>I think it's self explainatory.</p>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Do I have previous experience?</h3>
        <p>Yes, I work as an web developer intern in the Business College of California State University of Fullerton and already my instincts tell me the bottom of the page is not really where you want to put the previous experience...</p>
